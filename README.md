#### Lesson Summary:

A quick recap of hypothesis testing leads the way to a discussion on Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing. Students solve a quick example where they have to state what Type 1 and 2 errors are in a particular scenario. Next, students write code to run simulations for computing Type I and Type II error rate. Statistical power is introduced next, which leads to a discussion of effect size and a quick example to compute Cohen's d for two samples. After finishing the example, students perform a simulation to compute the power of a statistical hypothesis test. Next, students create visualizations to observe the effect of changing sample size, effect size, and significance level on power.  Finally, statistical power analysis is presented as a tool for experimental design, and students use the `statsmodels` library to compute power, detectable effect sizes, and sample size needed to achieve desired result in a test in a case study.
